<p>
The aims of this lab are:
</p><ul>
<li>to write and, importantly, validate some HTML
</li><li>to develop some familiarity with the formal markup language
specifications - both the descriptions and DTDs, and 
</li><li>to familiarise yourself with some of the developments and issues in markup language
specification and use. 
</li></ul>



<h4>W3Schools</h4>
<p>Work through the W3Schools Tutorial: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a>
from the start up to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">HTML Blocks</a>, and also to the section on
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">HTML Forms</a>.
</p>
<p>You don't have to complete every exercise, 
but it's a very useful reference and we recommend being familiar with the w3schools tutorials.</p>

<h4>Create your own home page</h4>

Create an HTML5 home page for yourself. The home
page should contain 
<ul>
  <li>A welcome message</li>
  <li>A photo</li>
  <li>A bullet list of the units you are studying, with each item in the list linked to the Unit Outline for that unit
    </li>
  <li>A table containing your timetable</li>
</ul> 

You may find it useful to access some of the HTML5 references provided
in the lectures.<br><br>



Do not be too concerned about page output layout at this stage although you
should use suitable indentation to show the structure of the page
source (see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> for setting up
auto-indentation in VSCode).
<br><br> 

<p>
Open the page in Firefox, Chrome and Opera to check that it works as
expected. You may also want to have a look at it with Internet Explorer (if you're in Windows). 
Depending on your operating system, you can also check it under Safari and SeaMonkey.

<br><br>
</p><p> 
Try adding a form to the page. The form should collect a users name, email and date of birth. 
Use HTML5 input types, and check that they work in the browser. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp" target="_blank">This W3Schools page</a> has some information on how to use JavaScript to take information from HTML
forms.



</p><h4>Validation</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Validate your HTML5 page using the validation service at:
<pre> <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">https://validator.w3.org/</a>.
</pre></li>
<li>
Try to fix any problems that appear during validation.
</li>
